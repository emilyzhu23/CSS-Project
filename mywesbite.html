  <!-- The slopes -->
  <h2 id = "Slope">Slopes?</h2>
  <p>
    Now there are of course various types of slopes, basically the snow you ski down, depending on your skill level.
    If you're a beginner, it's likely you'll start out on the bunny slopes. These are <em> easier to navigate and approachable</em> because they're generally less steep and pretty short.
    As your skill level increases, you'll be able to go for longer and steeper runs where <strong> you'll be able to go faster </strong>.

  <!-- Fear -->
  <h2 id = "Fear">Fear?</h2>
  <p>
    Okay. Sliding down an icy hill and having seeming no control over where you're going is scary. I can't deny that.
    There's definitely a little bit of danger involved with skiing especially in the very beginning when it's hard to stop or turn and there are a lot of people.
    But you get the hang of it and it becomes a lot less dangerous once you gain control over at least how to stop.

  <!-- Gear -->
  <h2 id = "Gear">Gear?</h2>
  <p>
    It's going to be cold. Obviously. So snow pants and a heavy parka. One that's definitely very important is gloves/mittens. I personally prefer gloves because dexterity.
    But either way, you need them. When you fall, you'll probably land somewhat on your hands so you definitely want to protect those from the snow. A helmet is also a neccesity for safety reasons.
    Goggles or sunglasses are also a must. The glare from the snow can really damage your eyes and also there'll probably be cold wind you don't want in your eyes anyways as you ski down. I know
    it might sound weird but I would suggest wearing sunscreen. The sun reflecting off the snow is pretty strong and you probably don't want a goggles tan line on your face.
